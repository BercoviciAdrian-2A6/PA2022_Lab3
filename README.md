Homework & Bonus:
Completed
*already fully presented, in main branch

Homework:
*Each node will contain a Map representing the time costs. Create and print the complete network in the example: DONE
*Create a default method in the interface Storage, that is able to return the storage capacity in other units of storage (megabyte, kilobyte, byte): DONE
*In the Network class, create a method to display the nodes that are identifiable, sorted by their addresses: DONE
*Implement an efficient agorithm to determine all the shortests times required for data packets to travel from an identifiable node to another: NOT DONE

Bonus:
*In addition to the time cost, each link between two network nodes has a probability of failure. You may want to read this: DONE
*Implement an efficient agorithm to determine the safest route for a packet to travel between two given nodes: DONE (compiles and runs, the result is not always correct)
*Generate random network instances with known optimum and test your algorithm using JUnit or other framework: DONE(random input is generated, with a known best solution, couldnt not integrate JUNIT)
